      Henry Ford built his first automobile, which he called a quadricycle, at his home in Detroit in 1896. The location
      has been redeveloped, where the Michigan Building now stands, and the tracks for the Detroit People Mover and the
      Times Square People Mover station are nearby. At the entrance to the Michigan Building, there is a commemorative
      plaque identifying the original location of the Ford home. The coal shed has been recreated using the original
      bricks at Greenfield Village in nearby Dearborn. His initial foray into automobile manufacturing was the
      Detroit Automobile Company, founded in 1899. The company foundered, and in 1901 was reorganized as the Henry Ford
      Company. In March 1902, after falling out with his financial backers, Ford left the company with the rights to his
      name and 900 dollars.
